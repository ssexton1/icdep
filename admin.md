## Problem
How can we send commands ("SLEEP", "RESTART", "ARE-YOU-THERE", etc) to individual nodes in the network, rather than treat them as pass-through intermediaries?
## Solution
To send commands ("SLEEP", "RESTART", "ARE-YOU-THERE", etc) to individual nodes in the network the bottom right of the front of the card will contain the instructions along with the target node. By including a target node along with the instruction, nodes along the way can be given instructions instead of only Bob receiving instructions from Alice. If Alice wants to give a direction to Bob she must include his UWNetID. If a star * is included instead of the UWNetId of a specific node then every node along the way shall listen to the command. Each node should respond with a new card that has a body message giving their response, a status in the top-right corner which is 1 if the command was successfully completed, 0 otherwise and their UWNetId also in the top-right corner so Alice can verify which node received the request.
